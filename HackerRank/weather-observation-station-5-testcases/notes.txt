PROBLEM
Query the two cities in STATION with the shortest and longest CITY names, as well as their lengths (i.e: the number of characters in the name). If there is more than one smallest or largest city choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically.

LOGIC
1.Shortest and longest city names.
2.Their respective lengths.
3.List aplhabetically.
