PROBLEM
The difference between the total number of City entries (total number of records) in the table and the number of distinct CITY entries (total number of unique city names) in the table.

FORMULA
city vals = new york, new york, bengalaru.
total number of records (r) = 3
total number of unique city names (u) = 2

The query returns 1 because:
r - u = 1

INPUT
SELECT (COUNT(city) - COUNT(DISTINCT city)) FROM station; /* worked - passed challenge /*

FAILED CODE - DESCENDING ORDER

050621
SELECT WHERE (COUNT(city) - COUNT(DISTINCT city)) FROM station;

050621
SELECT WHERE (COUNT (city-DISTINCT city)) FROM station;

050621
SELECT COUNT (city) FROM station; /* returns the number of records for city /*

050621
SELECT city FROM station 
WHERE SUM (city - DISTINCT city) 
ORDER BY city;

050621
SELECT city FROM station ORDER BY city; /* returns list of cities in ascending order. /*
