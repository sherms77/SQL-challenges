STEPS
1.Query list of city names: SELECT city FROM station; - DONE
2.Look up Oracle db syntax: Math operations - DONE
2.With even ID numbers only: MOD(id, 2)=0; - DONE
3.Exclude duplicates: DISTINCT - DONE

INPUT
1.SELECT city FROM station; - WORKS 
2.SELECT DISTINCT city FROM station; - WORKS, APPEARS TO EXCLUDE DUPLICATES 
3.SELECT DISTINCT city FROM station WHERE MOD(id, 2)=0; - WORKS

NOTES
130221: None of these are working because I need to exclude duplicates from the answer.
060321: How do I get even id numbers? Modulus does not work? Ie: %2=0.
060321: Refer to SQL Bolt lesson 9 (in notebook). Mathematical functions.
060321: Example from SQL Bolt lesson 9: SELECT title, year FROM movies WHERE year %2=0;
060321: As mentioned before, id %2=0 does not work. Unsure if its to do with Oracle db?
070321: SQL Bolt lesson 4. Filtering - exclude duplicates using DISTINCT. 
070321: Refer to links 1 and 2. Used relevant syntax for Oracle db.
070321: Finished challenge today.

TEST CODE
SELECT city FROM station where id > 0; # works - out: city names with id > 0.

FAILED | ORACLE

070321: 
    SELECT city FROM station WHERE MOD(id, 2); # refer to link 1 - oracle docs
    SELECT DISTINCT city FROM station WHERE id % 2=0; - NO OUTPUT
    SELECT DISTINCT city FROM station WHERE MOD(id, 2); - NO OUTPUT, INVALID RELATIONAL OPERATOR.

    SELECT city FROM station WHERE id % 2;
